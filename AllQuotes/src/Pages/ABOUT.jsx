      Welcome to my WDD 130 Final Project. This project is focused on creating a simple website while fetching and maniplulating data from APIs.
      In this project I am using quotes api from Quotable. I will be using specific endpoints so as to be able to get quotes under 4 topics: Love, Happiness, Inspiration and Success.
      There will also be some light CSS styles added to the site for visual.
